        We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email)

    <span>
      <h3>Storage Period</h3>
      Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy,
      your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing,
      your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your
      personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in
      the latter case, deletion will occur once these reasons no longer apply.

      <h4>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this
      website</h4>

      If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO or Art. 9 (2) (a) DSGVO, provided that special categories of data are processed pursuant to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing will also be carried out on the basis of Art.
      49 (1) (a) DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on
      your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing will also be carried out
      on the basis of Section 25 (1) of the Telemedia Act (TDDDG). Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the
      fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we will process your
      data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO. Furthermore, if your data is required to fulfill a legal obligation, we will process it on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (c) DSGVO.
      Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are provided in the following
      paragraphs of this privacy policy.

      <h4>Recipients of personal data</h4>

      As part of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transmission of personal data to these external parties.
      We only share personal data with external parties if this is necessary to fulfill a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., sharing data with tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in sharing according to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, or if another legal basis permits the sharing of data. When using processors, we only share our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.

      <h4>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h4>

      Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
      You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out
      up to the time of revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

      <h4>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)</h4>

      IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO E OR F DSGVO, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons related to your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which such processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. IF YOU OBJECT,
      WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA,
      UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING
      THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE
      PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND
      LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (1) DSGVO).
      If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes,
      you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing purposes;
      this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing. If you object, your personal
      data will subsequently no longer be used for direct marketing purposes (objection pursuant to Article 21 (2) DSGVO).

    <span>
      <h4>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h4>

      In the event of violations of the DSGVO, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a
      supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work,
      or the place of the alleged violation. This right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
      Right to data portability
      You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract
      handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.
      If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done if technically feasible.
      Information, correction, and deletion
      Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
      information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the
      purpose of the data processing, and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time with any questions about this or other issues related to personal data.
    </span>

    <br><br>

    <span>

      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      You can contact us at any time to do so. The right to restriction of processing exists in
      the following cases:

      <br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
          usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to
          request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can
          request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
        <li> If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it to exercise,
          defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to
          request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>
          If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balance must be struck between
          your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.</li>
        <li>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may
          only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to
          protect the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the
          European Union or a Member State.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
      This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator.
      You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the browser's address line changes from
      "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser bar. <br><br>
      If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be
      read by third parties.

      <h4>Objection to advertising emails</h4>

      The use of contact data published as part of the imprint obligation to send
      unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby prohibited. The
      site operators expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising information being sent, for example through spam emails.

      <h2>4. Data collection on this website</h2>
      Server log files
      The website provider automatically collects and stores information in so-called server
      log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These include: <br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>

        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
      </ul>

      This data will not be merged with other data sources.
      This data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a
      legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its
      website – for this purpose, the server log files must be collected. <br><br>
